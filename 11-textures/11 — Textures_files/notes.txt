ðŸš€ June Update

Since the version 0.152 of Three.js, colors might look different by default.

In order to get the same result as in the lessons, those two lines have been added to the code:

// Start of the code
THREE.ColorManagement.enabled = false

// After instantiating the renderer
renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.LinearSRGBColorSpace
You'll discover those properties later in the course.
